# loglevel <integer> [...]
#              Specify the level at which debugging  statements  and  operation
#              statistics   should   be  syslogged  (currently  logged  to  the
#              syslogd(8)  LOG_LOCAL4  facility).   They  must  be   considered
#              subsystems  rather  than  increasingly verbose log levels.  Some
#              messages with higher  priority  are  logged  regardless  of  the
#              configured  loglevel  as soon as any logging is configured.  Log
#              levels are additive, and available levels are:
#                     1      (0x1 trace) trace function calls
#                     2      (0x2 packets) debug packet handling
#                     4      (0x4 args) heavy trace debugging (function args)
#                     8      (0x8 conns) connection management
#                     16     (0x10 BER) print out packets sent and received
#                     32     (0x20 filter) search filter processing
#                     64     (0x40 config) configuration file processing
#                     128    (0x80 ACL) access control list processing
#                     256    (0x100  stats)   connections,   LDAP   operations,
#                            results (recommended)
#                     512    (0x200 stats2) stats log entries sent
#                     1024   (0x400   shell)  print  communication  with  shell
#                            backends
#                     2048   (0x800 parse) entry parsing
#
#                     16384  (0x4000 sync) LDAPSync replication
#                     32768  (0x8000  none)  only  messages  that  get   logged
#                            whatever log level is set
#              The  desired  log  level  can  be input as a single integer that
#              combines the (ORed)  desired  levels,  both  in  decimal  or  in
#              hexadecimal  notation,  as  a  list  of  integers (that are ORed
#              internally), or as a list of the names that  are  shown  between
#              parentheses, such that
#
#                  loglevel 129
#                  loglevel 0x81
#                  loglevel 128 1
#                  loglevel 0x80 0x1
#                  loglevel acl trace
#
#              are  equivalent.   The  keyword any can be used as a shortcut to
#              enable logging at all levels (equivalent to  -1).   The  keyword
#              none,  or  the  equivalent  integer representation, causes those
#              messages that are logged regardless of the  configured  loglevel
#              to  be  logged.   In  fact,  if loglevel is set to 0, no logging
#              occurs, so at least the none level  is  required  to  have  high
#              priority messages logged.
#
#              The  loglevel defaults to stats.  This level should usually also
#              be included when using other  loglevels,  to  help  analyze  the
#              logs.
